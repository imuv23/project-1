Health Care
This is a digital health project designed to provide personalized wellness insights. Based on a user's height and weight, the platform performs three key functions:

BMI Analysis: It calculates and interprets the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) to provide a clear understanding of their current health status.

Personalized Diet Plan: It generates a tailored diet plan aimed at achieving specific goals like weight loss or maintenance.

Health Risk Assessment: It analyzes the data to highlight potential risks for lifestyle-related diseases and offers preventive guidance.

The project aims to make health management simple, data-driven, and actionable for every user.
